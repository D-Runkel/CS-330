# CS-330
Final project from cs-330

How do I approach designing software?

 I design software firstly by understanding the problem the software is trying to solve, and from those requirements, I draw conclusions on how it could be done.
 This project helped me develop design skills related to creation of a objects in a 2d or 3d space. In openGL, things are often drawing from a bin of global 
 variables, which I have kept track of in a global header file. 
 
 How do I approach developing programs?
 
 For this program in particular, we developed it iteratively, everytime we learned some new knowledge, a chunk was carved out of the project. With every new milestone,
 more and more of the project was able to be completed.
 
 How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
 
 Computer graphics are used in a lot of industries, learning more about this topic opens up pathways that would otherwise be closed.
